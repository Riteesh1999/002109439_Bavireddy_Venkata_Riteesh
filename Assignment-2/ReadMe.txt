Bonus Question:
Instead of typically developing a webpage that resembles Linkedin, I have developed a different layout.
This layout is very easy to navigate and gives a complete overview of what I bring to the table.
This layout makes it easier for employer to identify my skills and helps them assess my value to their company.
I added button in the home section to add hover effects and to make the page more appealing.
